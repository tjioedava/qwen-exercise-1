# Flowchart Specification Consistency Checker

This tool evaluates whether a flowchart diagram accurately reflects the procedural logic outlined in a specification document (PDF format).  
It leverages a vision-language transformer model (Qwen2.5-VL) to analyze both visual and textual data, detecting consistencies, missing steps, and logical contradictions.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies

Make sure all required Python packages are installed by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> ðŸ’¡ It is strongly recommended to use a virtual environment to prevent dependency conflicts.

---

### 2. Run the Application

Execute the main script using:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will process the input flowchart image and specification PDF, then output a structured comparison result in the terminal.

---

### 3. Update Flowchart or Specification

To analyze a new flowchart or specification document:

- Replace the existing files:
  - `flowchart.jpg` â€“ your flowchart image
  - `specification.pdf` â€“ the textual specification to compare
- Ensure the new files use the **same filenames** as defined in `main.py`, or modify the `FLOWCHART_PATH` and `SPEC_PDF_PATH` variables in the script accordingly.

## File Structure

```text
â”œâ”€â”€ main.py                # Main executable script
â”œâ”€â”€ flowchart.jpg          # Flowchart image file (to be analyzed)
â”œâ”€â”€ specification.pdf      # Specification document (to be compared)
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt       # List of required Python packages
â”œâ”€â”€ result.txt             # Result generated by model
â””â”€â”€ README.md              # Project documentation
```

## Notes

- This project uses the `Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct` model from Hugging Face.
- Output is printed directly to the terminal and written in `result.txt`
